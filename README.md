## Comments

The install folder just has a script used to install the swift development kit. The steps were already on the internet, but not necessarily in script form.

## Limitations:
A backup (bu) script restoreFiles is weak for accomplishing software goals. Different ideas of a plan were observed in Jonah 1:1-3. Jonah fled from a travel plan to Nineveh, to travel where he wanted, Tarshish. Likewise, a plan that an equivalent swift shell would occur to replace sh/dash couldn't be verified. Maybe an equivalent swift shell was missed, or maybe the workforce wasn't planning to issue it? The POSIX spec by OpenGroup was also checked for updates for a swift shell due to the potential for non-programmers to have influence in book-work. But updates were missed in the book-work. So not much had happened in terms of a swift shell.
