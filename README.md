## Comments

The install folder just has a script used to install the swift development kit. The steps were already on the internet, but not necessarily in script form.

learning to run swift-docc for this repo - [link](https://sword-2.github.io/swift/documentation/diatheke).


## Limitations:
A backup (bu) script restoreFiles is weak as it uses the older shell with a lot of C/C++. Different ideas of a plan were observed in Jonah 1:1-3. Jonah fled from a travel plan to Nineveh, to travel where he wanted, Tarshish. The passage isn't about software, but a plan to use a swift shell for memory safety was not known to have resulted from the workforce delivering public services. The POSIX spec by OpenGroup was also checked for updates for a swift shell. Non-programmers might be able to have influence in book-work for the POSIX spec. But updates were not observed in the book-work. It was not possible to make a swift shell at this time, so the restoreFiles script remains weak / legacy C/C++.
