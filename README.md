## Comments

The install folder just has a script used to install the swift development kit. The steps were already on the internet, but not necessarily in script form.

## backup script restoreFiles:
The script restoreFiles is weak as it uses the older shell with a lot of C/C++. It is a little slow but was used to minimize software development and deactivate some C++ code run previously. It is weak due to using the old C/C++ shell instead of a newer swift shell for memory safety. No "equivalent" swift shell has been observed to date to do it that way.

Some [GAO recommendations](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fdam.defense.gov%2FPortals%2F47%2FDocuments%2FGAO-IG%2520Act%2FDoD%2520Response%2520to%2520GAO-IG%2520Act%25202022.xlsx%3Fver%3DQ19IYCln3fISvNM4NlGBeg%253d%253d&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK) were encountered and a one record, GAO audit project code 102984, recommended releasing 20% OSS (Open Source Software). The record also had a non-concurrence to the recommendation. It was unknown if there was any chance for a swift shell to appear in the OSS release sometime in the future.

Some more specifics such as non-concurring with doing or releasing a swift shell might help others. This can coordinate with potential other candidates by letting them be aware of doing it themselves instead of waiting for a 20% release. A non-concurrence for a swift shell could also make others aware that they might try to propose changes for a swift shell in [POSIX.1-2017 and simultaneously IEEE Std 1003.1â„¢-2017](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2018edition/) since this contains some C/C++ specifics at this time.
