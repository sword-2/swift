# README - install swift 5.7.1 on Ubuntu server 20.04


The script 5-7-1 has some code which had been used to install swift to Ubuntu Server 20.04. Some of the paths were custom to the computer. Two swift folders had been used - swift and swift\_. The folder ending in underscore contained the downloaded files like tar, gz, and binaries. This was separated so a backup program would not copy those to disk since they were already on the internet.
